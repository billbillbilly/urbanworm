# Urban-Worm

## Introduction
Urban-Worm is a Python library that integrates remote sensing imagery, street view data, and multimodal model to assess urban units. Using APIs for data collection and Llama 3.2 vision for inference, Urban-Worm is designed to support the automation of the evaluation for urban environments, including roof integrity, structural condition, landscape quality, and urban perception.

## Features
- download building footprints from OSM and global building released by Bing map 
- search and clip aerial and street view images using urban units such as parcel and building footprint data
- stream street view images via APIs 
- automatically calibrate the oritation of panorama street view 

## Installation
Please make sure [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is installed before installing urban-worm
For Linux, users can install ollama:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

#### MacOS
For mac users, it may be nacessary to install gdal:
```sh
 brew install gdal
```
If the installation method above does not work, try to install with conda if you have:
```sh
 conda install -c conda-forge gdal
```

The package urabnworm can be installed with `pip`:
```sh
pip install urbanworm 
```

## Usage
#### single-image inference
```python
from urbanworm import UrbanDataSet

data = UrbanDataSet(image = '../docs/data/test1.jpg')
system = '''
    Given a top view image, you are going to roughly estimate house conditions. Your answer should be based only on your observation. 
    The format of your response must include question, answer (yes or no), explanation (within 50 words)
'''
prompt = '''
    Is there any damage on the roof?
'''
data.oneImgChat(system=system, prompt=prompt)
# output:
# {'question': 'Is there any damage on the roof?',
#  'answer': 'no',
#  'explanation': 'No visible signs of damage or wear on the roof',
#  'img': '/9j/4AAQSkZ...'}
```

#### multiple (aerial & street view) images inference using OSM data
```python
bbox = (-83.235572,42.348092,-83.235154,42.348806)
data = UrbanDataSet()
data.bbox2Buildings(bbox)

system = '''
    Given a top view image or street view images, you are going to roughly estimate house conditions. 
    Your answer should be based only on your observation. 
    The format of your response must include question, answer (yes or no), explanation (within 50 words) for each question.
'''

prompt = {
    'top': '''
        Is there any damage on the roof?
    ''',
    'street': '''
        Is the wall missing or damaged?
        Is the yard maintained well?
    '''
}

# add the Mapillary key
data.mapillary_key = 'MLY|......'
# use both the aerial and street view images (with type='both')
data.loopUnitChat(system=system, prompt=prompt, type='both', epsg=2253)
# convert results into GeoDataframe
data.to_gdf()
```

More examples can be found [here](docs/example.ipynb).

## To do
The next version will have functionalities using Google APIs:
- search for units with address
- find historical images

An agent webUI is in the incoming development plan for providing interactive operation and data visualization.
